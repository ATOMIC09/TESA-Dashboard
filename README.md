# Overview
This project is a web-based demo for monitoring and controlling machines, providing real-time data visualization and Machine Learning (ML) predictions. It includes a home page for machine information and a Raspberry Pi controller page for ML-based predictions.

# Features
## 1. Home Page
Displays machine information by connecting to MachineAPI via WebSocket. The real-time data includes:

- Energy Consumption:
  - Power usage with simulated noise.
  - Voltage readings for three phases (L1-GND, L2-GND, L3-GND).
- Pressure:
  - A square wave value with added noise.
- Force:
  - A square wave value with added noise.
- Cycle Count:
  - An integer counter that resets to 0 after reaching 20,000.
- Position of the Punch:
  - A triangular wave indicating the punch position.

## 2. Server Controller
The server manages file storage and interactions with MongoDB, which stores file paths for various Raspberry Pi-related data. It supports the following functionalities:

- Reports:
  - Stores reports generated by the Raspberry Pi.
- Models:
  - Contains pre-trained ML models.
- Recorded Sounds:
  - Stores audio files recorded from the Raspberry Pi, controlled via the /raspberrypi page.

## 3. Raspberry Pi Controller
This page connects to a Raspberry Pi using MQTT over WebSocket and provides the following:

- Machine Learning Predictions:
  - Real-time predictions are displayed using a line chart:
    - X: Unknown.
    - N: Normal.
    - F: Faulty.

  - Confidence ratios are displayed alongside predictions in the same chart (dual X-axis).
- Prediction Logs:
  - A table lists detailed prediction results for easy review.

# Technologies Used
- Frontend: Next.js 14, TypeScript, WebSocket for real-time communication.
- Backend: Bun, MongoDB for data storage, and MQTT for Raspberry Pi integration.
- Visualization: Charts.js for displaying line charts of predictions.
- Raspberry Pi Integration: MQTT over WebSocket for ML predictions and audio recordings.
